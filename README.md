# LABORATORY-REACT-SKELETON

![./documentation/example.png](./documentation/example.png)

This project is a double app inside **NX** that show examples of how to use the Skeleton object from **material-ui** and the Skeleton object from **react-loading-skeleton**. In thse two apps, I show in a minimalistic example how to integrate a Skeleton in a react component.

## Running

Since I am using NX, the two apps can be run simultaneously with one single command:

```bash
$ nx run-many --target=serve --projects=app-materials,app-react-loading
```
